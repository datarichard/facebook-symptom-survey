## The Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey

The University of Maryland Social Data Science Center [Global COVID-19
Trends and Impact
Survey](https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation/), in short
form as **UMD Global CTIS**, is a partnership between Facebook Data for
Good, Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University, the Joint Program on
Survey Methodology at the University of Maryland, the Duke Margolis
Center for Health Policy, and Resole to Save Lives, an initiative of
Vital Strategies. A representative sample of Facebook users was invited
on a daily basis to report on topics including, for example, symptoms,
social distancing behavior, vaccine acceptance, mental health issues,
and financial constraints. Facebook provides weights to reduce
nonresponse and coverage bias.
